  \ a pizza with whatever toppings you can imagine!\n\n## Steps:\n\n1. Find the Pizza\
  \ recipe program ( pizza.pde ) and open it using Processing.\n2. Set your canvas\
  \ size in the setup method.\n```\n\nsize(width, height);\n```\n3. Draw a biscuit\
  \ colored ellipse for the pizza base, a red ellipse for sauce and a yellow ellipse\
  \ inside (for the cheese).\nDo this in the setup method. You can use R,G,B values\
  \ or the Processing Color Selector Tool to help you find the right colors.\n```\n\
  \nfill(color);\nellipse(x, y, width, height);\n```\n4. Get some topping images for\
  \ your pizza. Some examples are provided for you, but if you want to choose your\
  \ own toppings you can.\n\n\nMake a PImage variable for each type of topping at\
  \ the top of the sketch:\n```\nPImage pepperoni;\n```\nDrag and drop the topping\
  \ image file onto your sketch.\nLoad the topping image (in the setup method):```\n\
  pepperoni = loadImage(\"pepperoni.png\");\n```\nIn the draw method, use the image\
  \ command to draw the topping somewhere on your pizza:\n```\nimage(pepperoni,200,200);\n\
  ```\nIf your topping is too big for the pizza, resize the topping image. Do this\
  \ in the setup method.\n```\npepperoni.resize(30, 30);\n```\n\nRepeat the above\
  \ steps for more toppings.\n\nAdd more code so that the toppings are only drawn\
  \ when the user clicks the mouse (in draw method).\nMake sure you SAVE YOUR CODE\
  \ when you are done. \n                                \nOPTIONAL Add a different\
  \ topping with the right mouse click.\n```\n\nif (mousePressed && (mouseButton ==\
  \ RIGHT)) {}\n```\n\nOPTIONAL Use a background image to put the pizza in a box.\n\
  ```\n\nPImage pizzaBox = loadImage(\"box.jpg\");     //in setup method\npizzaBox.resize(width,\
  \ height);      //to match your canvas size\nbackground(pizzaBox);       //in setup\
  \ method\n```\n\nOPTIONAL: To play a sound when you add a topping....\n        \
  \                            First download a sound from freesound.org and drop\
  \ it onto your sketch\n\n                                    Import the minim library\
  \ Pocessing > tools > add tools > libraries (search minim)\n```\n\nimport ddf.minim.*;\
  \     //at the top of the sketch\nMinim minim;     //at the top of the sketch\n\
  AudioPlayer sound;    //at the top of the sketch\n\nminim = new Minim(this);   \
  \   //in the setup method\nsound = minim.loadFile(\"ding.wav\");      //in the setup\
  \ method\n\n// Put next 2 lines where you want the sound to play\nsound.play();\n\
  sound.rewind();\n```\n5. Make a PImage variable for each type of topping at the\
  \ top of the sketch:\n```\nPImage pepperoni;\n```\n6. Drag and drop the topping\
  \ image file onto your sketch.\n7. Load the topping image (in the setup method):```\n\
  pepperoni = loadImage(\"pepperoni.png\");\n```\n8. In the draw method, use the image\
  \ command to draw the topping somewhere on your pizza:\n```\nimage(pepperoni,200,200);\n\
  ```\n9. If your topping is too big for the pizza, resize the topping image. Do this\
  \ in the setup method.\n```\npepperoni.resize(30, 30);\n```\n10. Repeat the above\
  \ steps for more toppings.\n11. Add more code so that the toppings are only drawn\
  \ when the user clicks the mouse (in draw method).\n12. Make sure you SAVE YOUR\
  \ CODE when you are done.\n13. OPTIONAL Add a different topping with the right mouse\
  \ click.\n```\n\nif (mousePressed && (mouseButton == RIGHT)) {}\n```\n14. OPTIONAL\
  \ Use a background image to put the pizza in a box.\n```\n\nPImage pizzaBox = loadImage(\"\
  box.jpg\");     //in setup method\npizzaBox.resize(width, height);      //to match\
  \ your canvas size\nbackground(pizzaBox);       //in setup method\n```\n15. OPTIONAL:\
  \ To play a sound when you add a topping....\nFirst download a sound from freesound.org\
  \ and drop it onto your sketch\n\nImport the minim library Pocessing > tools > add\
  \ tools > libraries (search minim)\n```\n\nimport ddf.minim.*;     //at the top\
  \ of the sketch\nMinim minim;     //at the top of the sketch\nAudioPlayer sound;\
  \    //at the top of the sketch\n\nminim = new Minim(this);      //in the setup\
  \ method\nsound = minim.loadFile(\"ding.wav\");      //in the setup method\n\n//\
  \ Put next 2 lines where you want the sound to play\nsound.play();\nsound.rewind();\n\
