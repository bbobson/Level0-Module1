## Goal:

Share a secret message!

## Steps:

1. Create a password and store it in a String variable.
2. Using a pop-up, ask the first person for a secret message and store it in a variable.
3. Now use a pop-up to tell the NEXT user that they can only see the secret message if they can guess the passcode.
4. If their guess matches the password, show them the secret message.
5. If the password does not match, pop-up "INTRUDER!!"
