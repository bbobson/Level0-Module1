## Goal:

Use for loops to recreate the image above!

## Steps:

1. Find the Banana Split recipe program ( banana_split.pde ) and open it using Processing.
2. Use the code below to help you print “ice cream ice cream ice cream banana” on the sketch.  However, you can only use the words "ice cream" once in your code so you'll need a loop.
```

text("word", xPos, yPos);
```
3. Make sure you SAVE YOUR CODE when you are done.
